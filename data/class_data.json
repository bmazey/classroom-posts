Coming prepared with specific questions will greatly enhance the value of the review.\n\nPractice Test 3 and every AP Unit Check-In Quiz have been provided to you this morning. I advise you to watch the videos on AP Classroom for the topics you struggle with the most, take the check-in quiz, and then complete PT3 towards the end of the break if you want to maximize all materials.\n\nI am giving a large presentation on April 23rd -- while my availability via email will be inconsistent, I still encourage you to email me with any questions you may have.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nMr. Mazey",

Each student must weave a set of Turkish rugs using the emojis of their choice. The five required rug patterns are as follows:\n\n    Solid (20 points)\n    Horizontal (20 points)\n    Vertical (20 points)\n    Diagonal (20 points)\n    Plaid (20 points)\nAll rugs should be 11x11 String arrays. Students may also submit an argyle rug pattern for an additional +10 points. Please see the attached screenshots for pattern references.\n\nStudents are responsible for creating their own GitHub repository.\n\nI strongly suggest each student start by implementing a method to print a formatted 2D String array (ex: weave() method) and a separate method to generate each rug pattern (ex: solid() method). \n\nStudents must submit a link to their GitHub repository and screenshots of each generated rug pattern to receive full credit.\n\nLab 5 Due Date: Friday, February 14th @ 11.59pm",

      "text": "Lab 4: 👩‍🎤📈 OOPs! I Did It Again 👩‍🎤📈\n\nIn this lab exercise students will explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java by creating their own inheritance structure.\n\nKey Concepts\nInheritance (extends, implements)\nPolymorphism (instanceof)\nKey word abstract\nKey word super\nAccess modifiers (public, private), setter() / getter() design pattern.\nArrayList\u003cT\u003e\nThis lab is broken down into three parts -- students must complete all three sections to receive full credit. Students may work in groups, but all work will be submitted and graded individually. Students may begin the lab by forking \u0026 cloning the following repository: https://github.com/bmazey/st-saviour-oop-java\n\nPart 1: Unified Model Language (UML) Diagram (10 points)\nBefore writing code, students must first create a UML diagram which describes the relationship between their intended classes. The designed structure must contain at least four (4) classes: one abstract grandparent class, one parent class, and two children classes. The structure must also define at least one interface and a class which implements the interface. The UML diagram may be submitted digitally or drawn on paper.\n\nMore information on UML class diagrams can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-class-diagrams/\n\nLAB 4 PART 1 DUE DATE: Friday, December 13th 2024 (submitted in class, or on Google Classroom)\n\nPart 2: Java Implementation (60 points)\nAfter receiving approval on the diagram submitted in Part 1 students may begin the implementation of the designed structure. The structure must address the following criteria for full credit (10 points each):\nContains at least four (4) classes, with at least one class being abstract.\nDemonstrates working knowledge of key word extends.\nContains at least one (1) interface, and a class which implements the interface.\nDemonstrates working knowledge of key word super.\nDemonstrates knowledge of access modifiers (public, private) using setter() / getter() methods.\nMay or may not contain an example of ArrayList\u003cT\u003e.\nPart 3: Tests \u0026 Validation (30 points)\nYour lab submission should include tests which demonstrate polymorphic types and a functional inheritance hierarchy. The tests must address the following criteria for full credit (10 points each):\nAsserts polymorphic types using instanceof operator.\nConfirms presence of inherited methods \u0026 properties.\nContains example of ArrayList\u003cT\u003e if not defined in implementation.\nFor ten additional points (+10) students may demonstrate working knowledge of the protected access modifier.

The method should simulate a 50 / 50 coin flip and return \u0027Heads\u0027 or \u0027Tails\u0027. \n\nQuestion 3\nWrite a public static method boxCars() which accepts no arguments and returns a boolean. The function should roll two six-sided die and return true iff (if and only if) both die land on the number 6.\n\nQuestion 4\nDesign a Cake class. Your Cake class should include the following public data properties: flavor, layers, and isBirthday. The flavor property should represent the flavor of cake. The layers property should represent how many layers the cake has. The isBirthday property should represent if the Cake is a birthday cake or not.\n\nYour Cake class should implement a default constructor which creates a vanilla cake with three layers for a birthday.

When generated, the character should have stats randomly assigned from a default stat array. The default stats are strength, dexterity, constitution, charisma, intelligence, and wisdom. The default stat array is [15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]. The character class should have a method which pretty prints the stat sheet at the beginning of the game. (30 points)\nThe class which contains the main method should also contain a generateMonster() method which accepts no arguments and returns an integer which represents the roll required to beat said monster. The method should randomly generate three different monsters by making print statements. The distribution of random monsters should be approximately 50% / 33.33% / 16.66% with the lesser likely monsters requiring higher rolls to beat. (25 points)\nThe player character class should contain a roll() method which accepts a buff as a String and simulates a 20-sided die (d20) roll. Before rolling against the monster, the user is prompted to add either the advantage or guidance buff. The user input is captured and provided to the player roll. The advantage buff rolls two d20s, draws both die results, and returns the higher of the two. The guidance buff adds an additional four-sided die (d4) to a d20 roll, draws both, and returns the result. (25 points)\nThe game should require at least three successful monster encounters for the player to succeed the campaign. If the player fails a roll at any point the game is over and a GAME OVER message is displayed; similarly, a winning message is displayed after a successful campaign. (15 points)\nIf the player rolls a 20 at any point the game displays CRITICAL SUCCESS. If the player rolls a 1 at any point the game displays CRITICAL FAILURE. You may ignore any corner-cases involving the guidance buff. (5 points)\nPlease see the short video attached for a demonstration of a working sample game.\n\nStudents may implement any of the following features for a +10 bonus:\nKeep It Classy -- The game only allows the player to select from a predefined list of playable roles.\nTake Initiative -- The game performs an extra roll before combat to determine if the player or if the monster goes first and prints the result. The monster rolls a d20 while player rolls a d20 + (dexterity / 2). \nLevel Up -- The player character level increases by 1 every time the player defeats a monster successfully. When the player levels up two additional stat points are randomly assigned and a message is printed to inform the player.\nStudents are expected to submit their labs by posting a link to their GitHub repository and a short demonstration video similar to the provided example video. \n\nYou are the Dungeon Master! Consider using the links in this post when adding flair to your Bludgeons \u0026 Flagons game.\n\nLAB DUE DATE: Friday, November 22nd @ 11.59pm EDT",
